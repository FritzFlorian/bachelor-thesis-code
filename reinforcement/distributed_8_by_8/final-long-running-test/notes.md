# Testrun-Notes

## Hardware

Training Master: Quad-Core i5 PC (4 Threads), GTX 760 Graphics
Playing Slave: Quad-Core i7 Laptop (8 Threads), no Graphics

## Runtime

The test ran (in multiple smaller parts) a total of about 50 hours.

## Results

The test quickly showed winrates of about 95%, dominating the trivial AI besides som unlucky games.
After some time on this, very successfull checkpoint, the winrate dropped over the rest of the testrun,
maybe indicating overfitting to a dominant, not well generalizing playstyle.

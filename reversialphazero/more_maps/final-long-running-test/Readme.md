# Notes

For this test the NN was made more complex by doubling the amount of filters
per Layer to 64. Also 3 more maps where added for training. Also the batch size was
increased from 64 to 200 and game history size was increased to 200,
to allow better training on a more diverse data set.

The test ran about XXX hours. The results do not really differ from the last run,
this suggests that the stagnating training progress was not due to the NN but because
of settings for the Alpha Zero Tree Search.
